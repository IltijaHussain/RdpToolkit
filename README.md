# RdpToolkit
Module for generating and changing .rdp files using PowerShell

## Origin of Module

I have the desire to use PowerShell to manipulate the setting in an .rdp file, but there are no modules available. I found one old PowerShell 1 reference of using here-strings to accomplish this.

## Usage

Generate a .rdp by running the following command:

```

```
